-Overview of The Module 2 Challenge - VBA 

- Overview
    In this assignment we were running an analysis on a number of stocks which the output was to display total daily trading volume and return for a certain year.  The VBA script we created was designed to be able to input a certain year, 2017 or 2018 for this dataset, and then display the results for the various ticker symbols.  

- Results
    While looking at the results of our VBA it is important to note what we can tell from the results and what we can not.  
        The information we can tell from our analysis
            In 2017 the returns for each stock is positiver except for the "TERP" which had a negative 7.2 percent return.  We can also see the volume of each stock was typically in the hundered of thousands for most sotcks except for "DQ" and "HASI" which were less than one hundred thousand.  

            In 2018 we saw negative returns for all those same stocks except for "ENPH" & "RUN" which were the only two to have positve return for both years.  We can tell the overall trade volume was fairly similar for each year (roughly over 3 million), however each individual stock seems to have varied in trading volume.  If we wanted to look at both 2017 & 2018 we could do the math to see which stocks had an overall positive returns over the two years.  

        What we can't take away from this information
            From the charts we created we see the volume and trading returns over the entire years.  We are not able to tell when the total trading volume occured or how the return performed throughout the year.  Such analysis could be obtained from the source data but would require more elaborate tables.  Thus these tables should only be seen as the return if a stock was bought at the beggening of the year and not reflective if a stock was purchased later in the year.  We can also not tell the why of how these stocks performed or any expectation of future returns.


-Summary
    Advantages & Disadvantages of refactoring code
        Advantages: Of the multiple advantages of refacotring code, for this example we can tell the script runs faster as shown in the run time pictures compared to the original VBA script.  A refactored code can also look cleaner and easier to update for future analysis such as future years or additional ticker symbols.

        Disadvantages:  The main disadvantage of refactoring code is the time & effort put into rewriting and retesting the code.  This usually only pays off if you expect to have to re-use the script for future use.
